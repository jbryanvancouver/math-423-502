# Representation Theory of Finite Groups and Homological Algebra

This course is Math 423/502 and consists of two parts:

  * **Representation Theory of Finite Groups.** A representation of a finite group is an embedding of the group into a matrix group. Representations arise naturally for example when studying the set of symmetries of a geometric or combinatorial object. Representations can be uniquely decomposed into irreducible representations, and this can be effectively done through the theory of characters. 
  * **Homological algebra**. Homology and cohomology arise in a variety of subjects across pure mathematics and they are essential in  algebraic topology, algebra, and algebraic geometry. We will study homological algebraic in the setting of modules over a commutative ring which is broad enough to encompass most applications. 

Grades will be based on two exams, one on representation theory, one on homological algebra:
  * Item one
  * Item two
